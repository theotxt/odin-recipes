        Monster Curry!
    </p>
    <p> 
         <h4><em>Ingredients</h4></em>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 chicken thighs boneless and skinless</li>
            <li>5 medium carrots</li>
            <li>8-10 beets</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil i.e. canola</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2.5 cups dry rice</li>
            <li>water to cook rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>
    <h4><em>Marinade</h4></em>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoon-sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled</li>
            <li>3 large garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon crushed red pepper (or more for a spicier meal)</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 cup almonds</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup greek yogurt</li>
        </ul>
    <h4><em>Directions</h4></em>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut up the chicken thighs into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
            <li>Add all the spices, tomato paste, and yogurt to a blender or food processor.</li>
            <li>Blend until completely combined, scraping down and mixing the sauce as needed.</li>
            <li>Add the spice mixture to a bowl with the chicken and stir to completely coat the chicken. Cover and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Wash and dice the onion, carrot, and beets. Dice the beets into thin, bite-size pieces in order to shorten cooking times.</li>
            <li>Start the rice when you're ready to start cooking. Rinse the rice several times, add water up to your first knuckle of your finger when it rests on top of the rice, and press start on your rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge to warm up while you cook the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add half the butter and oil to a pan. When the butter is melted add the onion and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the carrots and beets and cook until they're tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the veggies from the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining butter and oil. When the butter is melted add the chicken and all the marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook until the chicken is completely cooked through, ensuring there is no pink in the center of the chicken - about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add back all the veggies and stir and cook for another 3-5 minutes, until everything is combined.</li>
            <li>Add the heavy cream.  Stir and mix until it's completely combined and then simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with the rice and be happy!</li>
