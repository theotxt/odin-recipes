    <h3> MEATPIE </h3>
    <p>
        Crispy, flaky, beautiful. Whether a Zora or a Goron, you're guaranteed to love a fresh Meatpie. Usually, I'll go for whatever the butcher at Hateno Village has in stock. If you go at the right time, the meat will be so fresh it's practically still walking around. A little bit of prep in this one, but worth every minute!

         <h4><em>Pastry</h4></em>
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups plus 2 tablespoons (455g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup plus 5 tablespoons (300g) cold butter, cut into tablespoons</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (150ml) ice cold water</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>
    <h4><em>Filling</h4></em>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound beef roast</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots</li>
            <li>1/4 medium onion</li>
            <li>2-3 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2-3 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h4><em>Directions</h4></em>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 400°F and add some ice to a small cup of water.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and salt to a mixing bowl. Cut the butter into tablespoon-sized pieces. Add the butter to the flour and begin rubbing it between your fingers while adding flour. This will create a breadcrumb-like texture. Make sure you leave some butter pieces as large as peas.</li>
            <li>Add 2/3 cup of your ice water and mix until combined. There should still be chunks of butter visible in the dough.</li>
            <li>Split the dough into two equal pieces, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least an hour but up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Dice the roast, carrots, and onion into small 1/4 inch cubes. Place them in a bowl and mix with a spoon until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the smaller amount of spices and then, based on look and smell add the rest if you feel it's necessary.  I, personally, use all the spices. Stir until thoroughly mixed.</li>
            <li>Take the dough from the refrigerator and lightly flour a large surface.  Place the dough on the surface and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough by rolling in once direction several times until it makes a large square.  Then rotate it 90°, add more flour under the dough, and roll it out until it forms your triangle.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the other piece, making sure both are the same size.</li>
            <li>Using a large round cutter cut circles into your pastry. Repeat on the other half of the pastry dough, ensuring you have the same amount of circles on each side. You may gather the scraps and re-roll the dough to cut more circles if you wish, but only re-roll once to prevent a tough pastry. Or, alternatively, cut your pastry into even squares, ensuring there's an even number on each half.</li>
            <li>Transfer half of the square/circle pastries to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking sheets.  Fill each square/circle with your meat filling to within 1/2 inch of the sides of the pastry case and no more than stacked double in the center.</li>
            <li>Dip your fingers into water and brush the empty edges of the pastries.</li>
            <li>Lay the last half of the pastries on top of the first half to make enclosed pies.  Gently press the pastries halves together with your fingers and then seal with a fork by pressing into the edges.  Poke 3-4 holes in the top.</li>
            <li>Whisk an egg with a fork and brush the top of the pastries with the beaten egg. Place in the oven and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the pastries are nice and browned and/or and internal temperature has been reached of about 165ish. Serve warm.</li>
