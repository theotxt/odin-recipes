    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p> Worried about baking for your Hero of Time? Worry no more my fellow Hylians, try out this recipe I found from <a href="https://rosannapansino.com/blogs/recipes/zelda-fruit-cake"> Rosanna Pansino</a>, local baker from Hateno Village. Unfortunately, this won't be as easy a process as <em>Our</em> Hero of Time has it, all he's gotta do is throw everything into a big pot and watch it go for a few minutes, but it's still not too difficult! Personally, baking and cooking is my enemy, but on a snowy day when the castle is quiet, there's nothing more sweet than a warm fruitcake looking out the window of the castle's highest tower.
